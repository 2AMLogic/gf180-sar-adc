# gf180-sar-adc

**PRIVATE — 2AM Logic proprietary IP. Canary block (wave 1).**

10-bit SAR ADC on gf180mcu (open PDK), designed by agents driving
[klayout-tools](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools) and the
open-source analog flow. Dual purpose, per the canary model: catalog
inventory (eventually silicon-measured) and tool forcing-function
(friction issues go to the public klayout-tools tracker).

Selection rationale: sky130 existence proofs port; no free measured competitor on gf180 (matrix row 4).

## Target specification (DRAFT — engineering to ratify, see issue #1)

| Parameter | Target | Stretch |
|---|---|---|
| Resolution | 10 bit | 12 bit variant |
| Rate | 1 MS/s | 2 MS/s |
| ENOB @ Nyquist | > 9.0 | > 9.5 |
| INL / DNL | < 1 LSB | < 0.5 LSB |
| Input | 0–3.3 V single-ended + diff mode | — |
| Power @ 1 MS/s | < 1 mW | < 500 µW |
| Area | < 0.1 mm² | — |
| Interface | SPI-readable + parallel | — |

Maturity ladder: simulation-complete → layout DRC/LVS-clean → shuttle
seat → measured silicon over temperature.

## Layout

```
spec/          ratified spec + decision records
design/        schematics / netlists (xschem)
sim/           testbenches + PVT corner results (ngspice)
layout/        GDS + DRC/LVS reports (klayout-tools driven)
measurements/  silicon characterization (empty until tape-out)
```
